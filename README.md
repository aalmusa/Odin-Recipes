# TheOdinProject-Odin Recipes

This project is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), where I am revisiting my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This particular project focuses on creating a simple website dedicated to recipes. 

## Project Overview

The website serves as a basic recipe collection and demonstrates my understanding of:
- HTML structure and semantics
- Linking between pages
- Using lists for organizing content
- Adding images and descriptive content

Each time I receive a new assignment, I will create a new repository. This repository, **odin-recipes**, is centered around recipes.

## Iteration Breakdown

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Created a main directory: `odin-recipes`
- Added an `index.html` file with standard HTML boilerplate and an `<h1>` heading titled "Odin Recipes."

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Added a `recipes` directory inside `odin-recipes`.
- Created a new HTML file for a recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`) with standard HTML boilerplate.
- Added an `<h1>` with the name of the recipe and linked the recipe page to the `index.html` file.
- Included a link back to the homepage on the recipe page for easy navigation.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Each recipe page contains:
- An image of the dish.
- A "Description" section with a paragraph describing the recipe.
- An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list of required ingredients.
- A "Steps" section with an ordered list detailing how to prepare the dish.

### Iteration 4: Adding More Recipes
- Added two additional recipes with the same structure as the first recipe page.
- Linked all recipes to the homepage using an unordered list for organization.

## Features
- **Simple Navigation**: Links between the homepage and individual recipe pages make it easy to explore.
- **Readable Structure**: Content is clearly organized with headings, lists, and images.
- **Extendable Design**: The project structure supports adding more recipes easily.
